## Database Description

I have chosen to create a relational database of the department I work in, Marist college IT.  

### Business Rules

* Within the IT Department there are sub-departments, each sub-department has a building location, room number, and name
* There are jobs in each department and a job can only belong to one department, each job is described with a name and description as well as a corresponding department
* All jobs have amends and are paid either a salary or an hourly wage depending on the job, a job can only have one pay option
* Jobs are worked by either student employees or staff, a student employee is a student of the college works part-time at the college. A staff member is a full-time worker at the college.
* Student employees have a status of either commuter or resident and are managed by one staff member 
* Student employees are assigned shifts and can only work a set amount of hours usually 20 and request a number of hours they would like to work
* Student employees are assigned projects that have set names and descriptions
* Staff may be deployed a device which has a serial and is either a desktop or laptop
* Everyone whether student employee or staff have a user account, the username is set as there last name and they set there own password
* All user accounts can be given access to drives, drives have a name and a maximum storage that cannot be exceeded(it can be increased, however)

 As of right now, I have ten tables within the entity relationship diagram. The first is the department's table which describes the id and name of each sub-department of Information technology at Marist. For each sub-department, there are jobs which exits within this table the name description and id of each job is stored. All jobs have salaries or a wage, this is where there amends table comes into play. Each job has a salary with is recorded in this table. Jobs are split into two groups, both tables, the first is staff level jobs which are full-time staff opposed to student employees who have restrictions on where and when they work. Groups of students makeup parts of sub-departments and are managed by staff of the same or similar departments, this exits within the Managers table. Finally, Both staff and student employees are users of Marist college and are assigned usernames, idâ€™s and set password.

There are two tables that stem off of student employee, shifts and projects. The shift table defines the hours that an employee has and the max hours that employee can work as it can vary. The projects table defines what the current project if any is assigned to a student employee as well as the name of that project.

For staff, there is a unique table for them exclusively, the devices table. This table exists to keep track of all assigned devices to staff only as well as there details in order to keep track of them and be available for repair.

This Database is a good representation of how the Information department currently is set up and operates, this will help in developing a working database that corresponds to this diagram.

## Table Definitions

### Amends

**3NF Justification** - This table is in 3rd normal form because there is a defined key: job_id which references Jobs: job_id and does not have any transitive dependencies, job_id is out of the table. Additionally no partial dependencies exist.

**Table description** - This table holds all the data for what job gets paid a staff salary or an employee wage as well as what that value is. It has 2 columns for each and either can be null depending on what job it is, determined by the job_id which is taken from the jobs table.

```sql

CREATE TABLE Amends(
    job_id             int                NOT NULL,
    salary            int,        
    wage             DECIMAL(5,2));

```



### Departments

**3NF Justification** - This table is in 3rd normal form because there is a defined primary key: dep_id and does not have any transitive dependencies. Additionally no partial dependencies exist.

**Table description** - This table defines the specifics of each sub-department within IT, including the name, location and room number of each department. This is necessary to refer to when finding what staff or employees are located where.

### Devices

**3NF Justification** - This table exists in 3rd normal form, there is a primary key and the transitive dependency was taken out of the table and exists as a foreign key, additionally there are no partial dependencies

**Table description** - This table defines what devices are deployed to who. This is only an option for staff and is a value of either Laptop or Desktop for dev_type. Additionally, there is a dev_id and a serial number to identify the device.

### Drives

**3NF Justification** - This table is in 3rd normal form because there is a primary key: drive_id and does not have any transitive dependencies, departments is out of the table. Additionally, no partial dependencies exist

**Table description** - This table holds all the data for all shared drives across the department. There are departments with drives and some without, it is even possible for a department to have more than one. Each Drive has an ID, a corresponding department ID, a name and the maximum storage of the drive, which can be altered to allow more room

    VALUES (10, 1, 'DesktopDevicesSharedDrive', '10TB');
```



### Jobs

**3NF Justification** - The jobs table has a primary key of job_id defined to refer to jobs further down the tables, it also has a foreign key referring to the department in which a job belongs. There are no partial dependencies within the table

**Table description** - This table defines a job with a name and description for each regardless if a person is a staff or a student employee there job is derived from the jobs table along with what department it belongs to.

```sql

```



### Projects

**3NF Justification** - This table has a primary key: prj_id  without partial dependencies and its transitive dependency was removed in making it a foreign key  

**Table description** - The projects table defines projects that are assigned to stu_employees only, staff assign these projects and oversee them but that relationship exists in one table higher Stu_Employee. Each table has a designated id, name description and a corresponding emp_id referring to Stu_Employee.

```sql
--Projects.sql
--Create and populate Projects Table
--Author: Daniel Gisolfi
--DB Management Final Project

CREATE TABLE Projects(
    prj_id            int                NOT NULL,
    emp_id            int                NOT NULL,
    prj_name        VARCHAR2(30)    NOT NUll,
    prj_descrp        VARCHAR2(80)    NOT NUll);

ADD CONSTRAINT pk_prj_id PRIMARY KEY (prj_id);

INSERT INTO Projects (prj_id, emp_id, prj_name, prj_descrp)
    VALUES (3, 2, 'Device Repairs', 'Organizing all personal device repairs');
```



### Shifts

**3NF Justification** - This table has a designated key of emp_id which is a foreign key to Stu_Employee. There are no transitive or partial dependencies making this table 3rd normal form

**Table description** - The Shifts table designates how many hours an employee has, will and can work. There is a set max amount of hours and is subject to change if it is during the semester or not. The table is connected to the Stu_Employee through the foreign key emp_id  

```sql
--Shifts.sql
--Create and populate Shifts Table
--Author: Daniel Gisolfi
--DB Management Final Project

CREATE TABLE Shifts(
    emp_id            int        NOT NULL,

    hours_worked    int        NOT NUll,
    max_hours        int        NOT NUll);

ADD CONSTRAINT fk_emp_id_shift FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES shifts(emp_id);


INSERT INTO shifts (emp_id, requested_hours, hours_worked, max_hours)

INSERT INTO shifts (emp_id, requested_hours, hours_worked, max_hours)
    VALUES (10, 13, 9, 20);
```



### Staff

**3NF Justification** - This table includes a primary and foreign key, no data is repeated and is void of any partial or transitive dependencies making the table is in at least 3rd normal form.

**Table description** - If a person is full time, and not a student they are classified as staff, and have there owned ID as well as first and last name. This table keeps track of who is staff in order to derive who gets a device, what pay they receive etc.

```sql
--Staff.sql

CREATE TABLE Staff(
    staff_id        int                NOT NULL,

    staff_fname        VARCHAR2(20)    NOT NUll,
    staff_lname        VARCHAR2(20)    NOT NUll);

ADD CONSTRAINT pk_staff_id PRIMARY KEY (staff_id);
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_job_id_staff FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES jobs(job_id);

INSERT INTO Staff (staff_id, job_id, stu_fname, stu_lname)

INSERT INTO Staff (staff_id, job_id, stu_fname, stu_lname)
    VALUES (10, 19, 'Kaitlin', 'Defranco');
```



### Stu_Employee

**3NF Justification** - This table includes a primary and two foreign keys, no data is repeated although the job_id and emp_id are similar each is necessary. The table doesn't include any partial or transitive dependencies making the table is in at least 3rd normal form.

**Table description** - This a large table containing a employees full name and status of whether or not they commute or reside on campus. Additionally it is connected to the Staff table to derive who manages each employee. 

```sql

```



### User_Act

**3NF Justification** - This table has 2 possible keys either emp_id or staff_id which depends on their job in the jobs table. Additionally, the transitive and partial dependencies have been removed making it a table in 3rd normal form.

**Table description** - All student employees and staff are users, each with their own account, the username is derived from there last name and the password is created by the user they would be hashed and salted but for now I left them as astricts as there is no need to retrieve them. Additionally, most users have access to at least one drive if not more so the access is stored in this table as well.
